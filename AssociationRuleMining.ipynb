With our dataset containing 9465 transactions, having 1% of those would amount to roughly 95 transactions, which I consider to be a significant amount of data for analysis. It might have also made sense to use 100 data entries to determine the support, but that would further reduce our itemsets.

Furthermore, we can also reduce the dataset size from 11200 to only 61 rows, which represents a reduction of 99.5% of the data.

Nevertheless, this does not necessarily mean that they are a good pair of items to recommend together, as we are only considering the support in this case, focusing solely on purchasing volume. We notice some differences for the items ranked second based on support, which range from pastry -\u003e coffee to cake -\u003e coffee or tea -\u003e coffee. This might indicate that coffee is a very popular pairing with these items. Indeed, coffee is the only item consistent in all association rules for the second-highest support for each day.

This means that if someone buys a cake, more than half of the time they also buy a coffee. This does not imply the opposite. Indeed, the rule coffee -\u003e cake has a confidence of 0.11, which is extremely small compared to the confidence we had for cake -\u003e coffee. Hence, this association rule can be exploited in order to increase revenue for the bakery. Also, this rule has a pretty high lift of higher than one, which means that they are highly correlated.

In this case, the items that seem to be ill-suited for promotion together appear to be coffee and bread. Despite their high support, as they are the most commonly bought items at the bakery, they have very low confidence, with bread and coffee having a confidence of 0.27 and coffee -\u003e bread having a confidence of 0.19. Furthermore, the lift that they exhibit is lower than 1, indicating that item Y is unlikely to be bought if item X is bought. Hence, this shows a negative correlation between the two items, since if they were uncorrelated and independent from each other they would have had a higher lift. Indeed, they also have negative leverage, further indicating that coffee and bread have a negative dependance.

Do these metrics support the claim that placing valentine cards next to the t-shirt stand will substantially  increase t-shirt sales? Explain your conclusion.\n","\n","From the table above, we can see that we have found the results we were looking for. We observe that the association rule \"valentine's card -\u003e tshirt\" has a very low support, barely 0.0002, which corresponds to only two transactions. Furthermore, we note that the lift is extremely high due to the very small support for both the antecedent and consequent. Additionally, the confidence is also very low, at 0.15. Nevertheless, it's important to notice that the very small number of transactions might not accurately reflect the actual correlation between the two items due to the small sample size. These low results could be attributed to outliers. It would be essential for us to conduct a power test to verify whether this association rule is robust enough to hold, but with only 2 transactions, it is very challenging to confirm the results found from this association rule. Personally, given this information, I would not believe that placing Valentine cards next to the T-shirt stand will substantially increase T-shirt sales."]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"name":"","provenance":[{"file_id":"1OwsThJCvbgvgeM5SquUaAnOL1GWWaLoJ","timestamp":1707002917061}],"version":""},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
